I developed this responsive portfolio using React.js and in this application, i showcase my creative and web development projects
as well as the multiple examples of functional JS components. 

My main objective was to build unique and challenging components such as, data handling (pagination, sorting, filtration and etc),
working with API (POST and GET methods), handling form data (Password, Feed back and general submission) and more. Additionally, 
for some portions of my application, i worked exclusively with Tailwind in order to maximize my skills using this framework.
